# SA Hospitals Map
A map built from the South African Hospitals Survey 2011-2012 data.

# Usage
Clone the repository down. Use `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000` to run a browser-accessible version locally.

# Overview
The "map" is very simple - I just used a simple Google Maps JS implementation, and wrote an intermediary script to filter the CSV data. The data comes as-is from the [code4sa data respository](https://data.code4sa.org/Health/South-African-Hospitals-Survey-2011-2012/ft5b-smjr).
